// The map has a wall of # characters all the way around its edge. More # characters are distributed around the inside of the map, and they act as walls too.

// The @ starts on an open space. After each move, the program draws the whole map again with the @ in its new place.

// The @ never moves onto a #: if the next space is a wall, it stays where it is.

// A Room class holds the map. The map's size isn't known until the program runs, so the Room allocates the map with new and releases it in its destructor.

// The Room can draw itself, with the @ at the player's position.
